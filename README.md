### My Excel Course Experience
I recently completed an MS Excel course through www.mygreatLearning.com , and it has been a highly enriching experience. The course covered essential features of Excel, from basic functionalities to more advanced data analysis techniques. It was structured in a way that was easy to follow, with hands-on exercises that helped me grasp each concept effectively. The instructors were knowledgeable and provided practical insights that were directly applicable to real-world scenarios.
### Examples of Excel Functions:
1. SUM Function:
- The SUM function is used to add up a range of numbers.
- Example: If you have numbers in cells A1 to A5 (say, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50), you can use =SUM(A1:A5) to get the total, which would be 150.
2. MIN Function:
- The MIN function returns the smallest number in a range.
- Example: Using the same numbers as above, =MIN(A1:A5) would give you 10, which is the smallest number in the range.
3. MAX Function:
- The MAX function returns the largest number in a range.
- Example: With the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 in cells A1 to A5, =MAX(A1:A5) would return 50, the largest number.
4. AVERAGE Function:
- The AVERAGE function calculates the average (mean) of a range of numbers.
- Example: Continuing with the numbers above, =AVERAGE(A1:A5) would give you the average, which is 30 (since (10+20+30+40+50)/5 = 30).
5. COUNT Function:
- The COUNT function counts the number of cells that contain numbers within a specified range.
- Example: If you have numbers and blank cells in cells A1 to A5, =COUNT(A1:A5) would count how many cells contain numbers.
#### By learning and applying these functions, I gained practical skills

My college journey began with listening to kirtan at the campus Gurdwara Sahib. It felt really good to receive blessings before starting something new. After that, we sat in the auditorium and listened to speeches from the guests on the first day. It was a nice way to kick off our journey.

4. I love you

After every mistake and lie, we should immediately seek forgiveness from God. We can deceive others, but we can't deceive ourselves or God. Deep down, we always know the truth behind our lies.Just like Newton's third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, whatever we give to the world and nature will eventually come back to us.
